Lynn Avery is a musician, improviser, composer, and artist based in Brooklyn, NY. Her work moves through traditional songcraft, dissonance, and texture, tracing the porous edges between form and space. She draws from traditions of field/bedroom recording, electro/acoustic experimentalism, maximalist/minimalist compositionâ€”treating sound as both artifact and inquiry. 

Ongoing projects include Iceblink and Pink Must, along with her collaborations with Cole Pulice, More Eaze, Wendy Eisenberg, Ryan Sawyer, Nadine, and Lia Kohl. 

She has performed at Pioneer Works, Knockdown Center, Public Records, Cedar Cultural Center, and The Lab. Her music has been featured in Pitchfork, Bandcamp Daily, The Quietus, The Current, Raven Sings the Blues, and Aquarium Drunkard.
