Lynn Avery is a multi-instrumentlist, improviser, composer, and producer based in Brooklyn, NY. Her work moves through songcraft, dissonance, and texture, tracing the porous edges between form and space. She draws from traditions of field/bedroom recording, electro/acoustic experimentalism, maximalist/minimalist compositionâ€”treating sound as both artifact and inquiry.

Her projects Iceblink and Pink Must, along with her ongoing collaborations with Cole Pulice, explore the synthesis of melody and noise, clarity and distortion - and the use of each instrument as both texture and foreground.
She has collaborated with artists such as More Eaze, Wendy Eisenberg, Ryan Sawyer, Nadine, and Lia Kohl. 

She has performed at Pioneer Works, Knockdown Center, Public Records, Cedar Cultural Center, and The Lab. Her music has been featured in Pitchfork, Bandcamp Daily, The Quietus, The Current, Raven Sings the Blues, and Aquarium Drunkard. She has composed music for full length and short films.
